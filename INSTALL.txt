INSTALLATION

* UN*X

perl Makefile.PL
make
make install

beware that this module is not very useful on UN*X platforms

* Win32

perl Makefile.PL
# this will output a line -Using: 'MAKE'- where MAKE is either dmake or nmake
MAKE
MAKE install

COMPILING PERL MODULES FOR ActivePerl ( build 6xx ) with MinGW

REQUIREMENTS

* MinGW GCC 2.95.2-1 or better
  plain 2.95.2 has a bug while handling -DMACRO=\"value\"

* ActivePerl build >= 616 (8xx are fine, too)
  this procedure might or might not work with earlier 6xx builds,
  it will _surely not_ work with 5xx builds

* dmake ( or nmake )

Download these from

Perl:

GCC:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/

dmake:

PROCEDURE

* Install ExtUtils::FakeConfig and Config_m ( see above )

* create a suitable import library
    Let's assume that your Perl is installed in C:\Perl, then from the
    command line do (all in one line, split here for clarity)

  perl script\make_implib.pl --output-dir=C:\Perl\lib\CORE
                             --output-lib=libperl56.a
                             --target=mingw c:\Perl\bin\Perl56.lib

COMPILING THE MODULES ( works with Perl-only modules, too )

for this to work gcc.exe should be in the PATH when you run Makefile.PL

perl -MConfig_m Makefile.PL
dmake
dmake test
dmake install

Good luck!
